1. The first thing I did when I opened this repository is look at the overall website and notice the things that I knew were part of
   the task.
2. The most confusing moment was making a copy of the repository. There wasn't a place that explicitly said 'make a copy' or anything
   along the lines of that. So many of the terms with this specific task were unfamiliar to me, like forking or branches. It was also
   confusing figuring out how my copy connected to the original, or if it saves, if others can see, etc.
3. When I got stuck, I reread the instructions multiple times and really thought about what each word meant. I also searched online for
   different meanings of terms used on github, or how to do a certain action. I also looked at what others who had done the diagnostic
   did, especially with the files and folders.
4. I decided to read all the information in the given instructions, and I skipped the things I wasn't sure about on Github that
   weren't part of the task. I also read the information I needed when searching online, and read it on multiple sites/videos to
   ensure I'm doing the correct thing that everyone would do on Github. However, I also skipped unnecessary information that I didn't
   think related to the task or what was asked of me.
5. I feel more confident about creating and viewing files and folders. I also feel confident about new terms I've learned specific to
   Github.
6. The main thing that feels unclear is the overall organization of projects, repositories, forking, branches, and how these things
   actually work relative to each other. It's also still unclear how my copy or branch would affect the main, and in general how to make
   it so it does or doesn't, assuming that's possible.
